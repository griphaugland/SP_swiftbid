## sp_swiftbid - Semester Project Auction House

### Project Overview

Welcome to the `sp_swiftbid` project! This project is an auction house platform designed for a semester project. Built with modern web technologies like Bootstrap, SASS, PostCSS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, it offers a rich and interactive user experience.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:griphaugland/SP_swiftbid.git

This will install all necessary dependencies such as Bootstrap, SASS, and PostCSS as defined in your package.json.

### Usage
